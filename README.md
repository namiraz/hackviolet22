# In Every Byte (live demo [here](https://in-every-byte.herokuapp.com/))

Have you ever stood in your kitchen, looked at the groceries you bought, and ignored it all in favor of a bowl of cereal? We have too. In order to get the most out items we already have at home, develop our cooking skills, and cut down on food waste, we decided to create a system that prioritizes ingredients and fights against monotony by providing a variety of dishes every time â€” no new grocery trip needed.

Here's how it works:

1. Enter the ingredients you have in your list in a comma-separated format.

2. Enter the number of recipes you want.

3. Hit the **find recipes** button.

4. Enjoy!
